# SysId Robot Characterization

Consult the [WPILib documentation on robot characterization](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/software/pathplanning/robot-characterization/index.html).

## Swerve

Characterizing serve drivetrains have extra considerations. The robot code generated by SysId does not do anything to keep the wheels pointed straight. All the wheels need to be locked into place. This can be accomplished by wedging a piece of wood between the frame of the robot and the wheel.

Wheels need to be oriented with the bevelled gears facing into the robot. On the SDS Mk3 modules the drive bevel can stick out and press against the wedge. The wood wedges can be held in place with woodworking clamps. This will likely require removing the bumpers.

Use the configuration in `config.json` to generate the robot code.

## Data

Data file output from characterization should be stored here for future examination.
